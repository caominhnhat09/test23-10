# Portal filter and export steps

Goal: create the team CSV from NYC Open Data using documented filters, so anyone can reproduce it.
The values below come from `config/dataset_config.json`.

## Option A: portal user interface

1. Open the dataset page (link in `DATA_SOURCE.md`, section 1).
2. Click **Filter** (or "View Data" and then "Filter").
3. Add filter: **Created Date** is on or after `09/01/2026`.
4. Add filter: **Created Date** is before `10/01/2026`.
5. Add filter: **Borough** is `BROOKLYN`.
6. Check the row count shown by the portal. Keep it under the configured limit.
7. Take a **screenshot of the page showing all active filters and the row count** and save it as
   `provenance/portal_filters_screenshot.png`.
8. Click **Export** and choose **CSV**. Save as `data/raw/nyc311_brooklyn_2026-09.csv`.

## Option B: API URL

1. Run `python scripts/build_export_url.py`.
2. Open the printed URL in a browser (or use any download tool) and save the CSV to the path shown.
3. Save the printed SoQL filter in `provenance/saved_filter_description.txt`
   (this counts as the "saved filter description" required by the project).

## After the export (both options)

1. `python scripts/verify_dataset.py`
2. Copy the values from `provenance/dataset_manifest.json` into `DATA_SOURCE.md`.
3. Make sure no `<<FILL>>` remains in `DATA_SOURCE.md`.
4. Share the CSV and its SHA-256 with the team. Nobody should re-export without updating the hash.

## Checklist (grading: environment/data/reproducibility)

- [ ] Filters documented exactly (dates, borough, limit)
- [ ] Screenshot or saved filter description in `provenance/`
- [ ] `DATA_SOURCE.md` complete, no placeholders
- [ ] CSV hash recorded and identical for all members
- [ ] Analysis runs offline using only the saved CSV
